We need a central voice or even collective voices of hope and optimism to get through this tough phase!!

SACKING ANGE IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THIS DILEMMA üôÖüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!! 

This is the time for everyone (players, coaches, staff, fans) in the club to reflect on all of our choices and decisions that brought us to what we are now.

We need to reinvent, rethink, restructure and manage our expectations on the team, given the players we have in the club.

My ball and club operations knowledge is minimal and the best I can ever do from my side is support and stick through the toughest of times.

I truly hope Daniel Levy and the board members take the time to WELL AND TRULY reflect on how they can improve the club, FROM STRICTLY A FOOTBALLING PERSPECTIVE AND NOT INTRODUCE NEW ATTRACTIONS IN THE STADIUM 

As for the players, do what you know best. Do not over-complicate your game and try playing as straightforward as you can. Try not to let the pressure get to you as much as you can. 

Help out your teammates holistically, so that you can lift each others' spirits up.

And as for us fans, let's not abuse our players!! They would be expecting to receive some love and consoling during this tough time ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº

Let's all pray to get out of the dilemma as soon as we can üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº

Galatasaray vs Spurs

The defending until the time Lankshear got sent off, was abysmal. I think even a team like Albirex Niigata would've defended better over there ü§¶

The second half was clear evidence to see that our First team's mentality is strong, after the introduction of Kulu, Solanke, Sarr and Bentancur üí™üß†

Lankshear must be proud of bagging his first senior goal, but must really work on his composure 

I'm baffled by the removal of Son and Brennan after the first half!! Idk if Ange did that to retain their fitness or was just a tactical change

To summarise, I think our fringe players and youngsters need to build more confidence to avoid such capitulations

We'll take valuable lessons from the game and we move forward ü§çüíôüí™!!

Spurs vs Manchester City Post Match Reaction:

A SPECTACULAR PERFORMANCE FROM THE LILYWHITE BOYS ü§©‚ÄºÔ∏è

It was frustrating to not see all the chances in front of goal, converted properly. But they did eventually do enough to get the job done.

Plenty of players went down injured and some had to get off out of concern, that too from both teams. So I hope none of the injuries sustained by them are too serious üôè 

BISSOUMA'S LAST DITCH SAVE WAS INCREDIBLE AND SAVED OUR GAME COMPLETELY ü§Øü§Ø.

Seems like the FA wants us  to play the entire city of Manchester before we get to the eventual trophy üòÖ

This week we scored loads! Next game, are we gonna score loads or take in loads? Hope we consistently dish out high quality performances and not go off and on like a flickering lightbulb

Kudus forgot he was playing football I think. The moment he saw the stool to sit on after scoring West Ham's first goal, he switched from football mode to WWE mode

Pedro really needs to improve his awareness on the field. He must remember he's a defender and he has to defend

Streak cut for Dom and Johnson! But it's not the end of the world, I know they'll start scoring goals again soon

Sarrman the difference maker, changed the complexion of the game and got us playing Red Hot Chili Pepper football ü•µüî•üî•üî•

Swede Inji Iduppazhagan Kulusevski triggered our comeback and the MOTM for his performance is well deserved
